            <p>
                Betta is a large genus of small fishes ranging from 1-5.5 inches. They are often colorful, ray-finned and commonly found in low-oxygen water conditions, like, rice paddies, slow-moving streams, floodplains, and large puddles.

            <p>
                The Siamese fighting fish <i>(Betta splendens)</i>, also known as the betta, is a popular fish in the aquarium trade. They are a member of the gourami family and known to be highly territorial. Commonly known for their magnificent fins of different colors and the flaring of their gill covers. Males are prone to high levels of aggression and will attack each other if housed in the same tank. Females bettas can also become territorial towards each other if they are placed in a small aquarium. It is also not recommended to keep male and female bettas together except for breeding purposes.

                    Taking care of bettas require a lot of patience and discipline to ensure they stay happy and healthy.

            <h4 class="bettacare_tank">Betta Tank</h4><br>
                <p class="pg_tank">
                    Bowls are too small for the betta fish. Keeping them in a 5-gallon glass or plastic tank allows the betta fish to exhibit normal activity and will result in less build-up of toxins in the tank.

                    Do not use tap water as they could contain chlorine/chloramine or heavy metals. Water should be dechlorinated. you can also use mineral water. Installing a low flow filter is also advisable.

                    They feed on brine shrimp, larvae and worms (daphnia, mosquito larvae, blood worms, etc.) You can also feed them balanced pellet or flake. Do not overfeed. Per day, they should be fed an amount of food they can eat within 3-5mins without leftover. Leftovers can cause the tank water to become contaminated.

                <p>
                    Females have shorter fins, more dull color than their male counterparts. If you look at the belly of a female betta you will notice a white spot called the egg spot.
                </p><br>
                <p>
                    Not to be confused with Plakat betta as female bettas have tails that are thinner and have less taper.

        <br><br>
        <div class="breeding">
            <h3 id="bb">Breeding Bettas</h3><br>
            <h4>Selecting the pair</h4><br>
                <p>Male should be well conditioned, supply them vitamins and feed them live food. Another good sign from the male is being aggressive.</p><br>
                <p>For the female, same with the male. They should be conditioned. And to determine whether your female is ready for breeding, the belly should be larger which means the eggs are healthier and bigger - higher survival rate for the offspring.</p><br>
            <h4>Breeding Tank</h4><br>
                <p>You can use a glass tank or plastic containers at least 12 inches wide. But make sure that the material of the container you will use is not toxic. For the water, you can use water from other fish tanks or you can also use stock water just make sure it is free from chlorine and not contaminated. Add plants to culture infusoria and almond leaves to increase fertility. Fill the container with water at least 3 to 4 inches deep. Place the tank in a well-lit area to stimulate the growth of bacteria.</p><br>
            <h4>Transferring the Pair</h4><br>
                <p>Place a transparent container to separate the female from the male. Leave them together for 12 hours. It’s better to place them in the tank at 12 noon and merge them at 6am the next day. You will know when the male is ready if it already built a bubble nest.</p><br>
            <h4>Mating</h4><br>
                <p>It is normal for the male to be aggressive to the female but make sure that you place a large leaf or a live plant for the female to hide at. Place a glass or transparent cover on your breeding tank to avoid the betta fish from jumping out. It also advisable to place some leaves on top to give the pair some privacy and for less disturbance when passing near the tank. You will know that they have successfully mated if there are white spots on the nest. These are the betta eggs.</p>
        </div>
        <br><br>
        <div class="fry">
            <h3 id="bf">Betta Fry</h3><br>
                <p>On the 3rd day the eggs will hatch. Keep them with the male until the fry are in free swim stage then remove the male from the fry. It’s good to have live plants in the tank as baby bettas eat the infusoria from these plants. Remove about an inch of water from your breeding tank so that the baby bettas can find there food quickly and grow faster.</p><br>
            <h5>Betta fry food:</h5><br>
                <ul>
                    <li>Baby brine shrimp</li>
                    <li>Infusoria</li>
                    <li>Egg yolk</li>
                </ul>
                <br>
            <p>After a week they can be fed baby brine shrimp, but larger betta types can be fed baby brine shrimp at the start of free swim stage.</p>

            <h3 id="bdat">Betta Diseases and Treatment</h3><br>
            <ul>
                <li>Fin Rot - antibiotic medications like sulfadimidine and erythromycin are usually effective</li>
                <li>Ich - Salt bath or medications like malachite green. Raise temperature of water</li>
                <li>Popeye - antibiotics like tetracycline</li>
                <li>Velvet - Salt bath or medications</li>
                <li>Dropsy - Salt bath and antibacterial fish food (food mixed with chloromycetin and tetracycline)</li>
                <li>Mouth fungus - Fasting for three days. Raise temperature of water</li>
            </ul><br>
            <p>The earlier you treat your betta the higher the possibility your betta will fully recover, so keep an eye out for these symptoms:</p><br>
                <ul>
                    <li>Unusually hovering around the surface of the water</li>
